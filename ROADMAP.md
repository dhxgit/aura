Aura Development Roadmap
========================

1.2.0.0
-------
- The Great Abstraction
- New `-M` option for building packages from the ABS.
- This will make `A` and `M` run on the same backend.
- Depedency checks will be unrestricted and beautiful.

1.3.0.0
-------
- libalpm introduction
- Functions in Aura will be converted where applicable
  to run on libalpm. Should make certain things more elegant
  and programmatic.

2.0.0.0
-------
- Full release from `pacman`.
- Aura will ascend to the status of full package manager and
  be completely based on libalpm. It will be a full replacement
  for pacman.
